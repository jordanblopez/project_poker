npm install 

I based this project off of https://github.com/tpiros/online-cardgame, I used it
as a platform to build off of. It also the only way I could wrap my head around
this project, I went through and reorganized the files and rewrote them into classful
format.

I know it looks like only a couple hours went into it but I did put it close to 60
hours worth of work (ugh I'm so slow) and man does it not show. Oh well. 

Anyways, 
I enjoyed your class, liked your teaching style, maybe more examples while you teach
I liked going over it and immediately seeing what it does.

does:
  - display two sets of 5 cards
  - players can get new cards
  - there is a limit
  - displays the loser in the browser, winner in console

does not:
  - limit the amount of cards one can replace
  - doesn't do it all at once
  - display anything when the rounds end
  - display winner in browser
  - have a way to keep playing
  - display what round it's on
